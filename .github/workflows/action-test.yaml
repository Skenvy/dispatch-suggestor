    # Suggests dispatchable workflows for a branch that would otherwise trigger
    # the dispatchable workflows from pushes to the trunk.
    #
    # So we want to try the action in a variety of ways. Version 1 functionality
    # should be: IFF a push to the "trunk-branch" would trigger a dispatchable
    # workflow, that wasn't already triggered by a non-trunk-branch push to a PR
    # branch, then we want that to be commented. It's fine if the workflow was
    # triggered by the pull_request event on the same branch or paths conditions
    # so long as it was not via the push event.
